# Grazer Linuxtage

The [Grazer Linuxtage](blog/20250101-board_meeting/index.md) is conference about open-source software and hardware and was held in Graz, Austria from April 25th to April 26th, 2025.

Naturally we felt like it was the perfect place to give a quick overview about private.coffee and it's services.
You can find the _lightning talk_ here (in german):

We met quite a few people who actually already knew us and our services which was pretty cool!
A lesson that we learned is that we should probably reach out more to other similar associations and collectives to coordinate our efforts.

We also had quite a bit of private.coffee merchandise with us, from stickers to shirts and hoodies that we wore during our time there. For next year we will try to get some pamphlets or flyers printed out, to hand them out to people. And maybe we'll even go for our own booth, but let's see how that goes.

Kumi, jupfi and ogalbnafets were there and we had a great time - here are some pictures from the talk:

Hopefully we'll see some of you there next year as well!
