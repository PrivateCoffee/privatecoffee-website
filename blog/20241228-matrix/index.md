## Why Matrix?

First of all we want to give a short overview of what Matrix is and why we chose it.

### Decentralized communication

Matrix is an open standard for communication over the internet. It is also a decentralized platform meaning there isn't a single corporation that controls it (like WhatsApp or Telegram), but different servers can be hosted by different organizations and those servers can communicate with each other. This means that you can choose the server that you trust and still communicate with people on other servers. In that regard it is similar to email, but with a focus on real-time communication.

### End-to-end encryption

You can use end-to-end encyption to

### Features

You can use Matrix for a variety of different things:

- Instant Messaging
- Voice and Video Calls
- File Sharing
- Group Chats
- Bots
- Bridges to other platforms (e.g. Telegram, WhatsApp, IRC, Discord)

## Clients

To use Matrix you need a client.

## Server Information

You can find some more information about our homeserver on the following pages:

- [Terms & Privacy](https://matrix.private.coffee/_matrix/consent?v=1.0)
- [Private Coffee Terms](https://private.coffee/terms.html)

## Registration

We provide a Matrix homeserver with conditional registration. This means you can create an account via our [online form](), but you will have to provide the following:

- A valid email address
- A short description of why you want to join our homeserver and what you expect from it

## Why did we move to conditional registration?

Short answer: Nazis, bots and  spammers. However we noticed that moving to a conditional registration actually made the server feel more like a community and people feel safer.
Maybe that is how the internet ought to be, a place of community where people can feel safe and not be harassed easily.
You can still stay anonymous on our server and we respect your privacy.
